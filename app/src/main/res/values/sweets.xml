        <item>take condensed milk in a bowl. with a wired whisk, beat the condensed milk for 2 minutes continously. also preheat your oven to 180 degrees celsius/356 degrees fahrenheit for atleast 15 minutes before baking.</item>
        <item>then add the desiccated coconut. add the coconut in batches. overall i added 1.5 cups of unsweetened desiccated coconut (90 grams) in two batches. mix well.</item>
        <item>then add next batch of ½ cup of desiccated coconut.</item>
        <item>mix again very well. the mixture consistency should be like what is shown in the pic. it should not be batter like. a thick dropping consistency is also fine. depending on the type of desiccated coconut, you may require to add more or less than what is mentioned in the recipe. so add accordingly.</item>
        <item>add ½ tsp vanilla extract or vanilla essence. mix again very well.</item>
        <item>the mixture is sticky. so rub some coconut oil or butter in your palms and pinch balls from the coconut mixture. roll and flatten them. place them on a greased baking tray. do grease the tray well with coconut oil or butter. you can also spoon the mixture on the baking tray. i wanted an even shape and look, so i shaped them in round cookies.</item>
        <item>press lightly half of each glazed red cherry on the macaroons. cherries are optional and you can skip them.</item>
        <item>bake at 180 degrees in a preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes till they are pale or light golden from the top. do keep a check as oven temperatures differ.</item>
        <item>this is how the bottom of these coconut macaroons should appear. slightly more browned than regular cookies.</item>
        <item>after 2 minutes, remove the macaroons with a flat spatula. do where oven mittens as the baking tray will be hot. place the macaroons on a wired rack to cool. once the coconut macaroons, cool completely then store in an air tight jar. serve eggless coconut macaroons as a sweet dessert cookie or with milk.</item>

        <item>1 cup water, 250 ml</item>
        <item>1 to 2 tbsp all purpose flour to be added later after the batter has fermented</item>
        <item>for sugar syrup:</item>
        <item>1 cup sugar, 150 grams</item>
        <item>½ cup water, 125 ml</item>
        <item>¼ tsp saffron strands/kesar</item>
        <item>ghee or oil for deep frying</item>
    </array>
    <array name="DIRECTIONS_SW_ITC101">
        <item>in a mixing bowl, take 1 cup all purpose flour or maida. add 2 tbsp besan or gram flour, a pinch of baking soda and Pinch of turmeric powder.</item>
        <item>mix all the above dry ingredients with a spoon or spatula.</item>
        <item>then add water. the amount of water to be added depends on the quality of flour used. i added 1 cup water. depending on the quality of flour and besan, you can add from ¾ to 1 cup water.</item>
        <item>with the spatula or spoon, first mix. break the small or tiny lumps with the spatula or spoon while mixing.</item>
        <item>then in round circular directions stir the batter briskly for 4 minutes. this adds volume to the batter and makes it even and smooth.</item>
        <item>the batter should have a flowing consistency. cover and keep the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 to 15 hours. i kept for 15 hours. if you live in a cold climate, you can keep for 20 to 24 hours.</item>
        <item>this is how the batter looks the next day. you will see small bubbles on the top.</item>
        <item>stir the batter and if you carefully see, the batter would have become thinner than what it was before fermentation.</item>
        <item>so to thicken the batter again, add 1 to 2 tbsp of all purpose flour.</item>
        <item>with a spoon mix very well.</item>
        <item>now pour this batter in the squeezy tomato ketchup bottles that we get in the market. you can also use coconut shell and make a small hole in it. you can also use a piping bag or make your own with butter paper. depending on the capacity of the bottle, you can pour less or more in it.</item>
        <item>take 1 cup sugar in a pan. add ¼ tsp saffron strands to it. do add saffron as it gives a nice orange yellow color and also its aroma to the jalebis.</item>
        <item>add ½ cup water.</item>
        <item>keep this pan on stove top on low flame and begin to stir, so that the sugar dissolves.</item>
        <item>on a low to medium flame, cook the sugar syrup.</item>
        <item>cook till you get one string consistency in the sugar syrup.</item>
        <item>once you get the one string consistency, switch off the flame and add ¼ tsp lime or lemon juice. stir well. keep the sugar syrup on the burner itself so that it remains warm when you add the jalebis in it.</item>
        <item>frying jalebis:</item>
        <item>heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. you can also use ghee or half-half of oil and ghee. ghee gives a better flavor.</item>
        <item>to check the temperature of oil, add a tiny amount of batter to the oil. if it comes up quickly and gradually the oil is hot enough for the jalebis to be fried. the frying temperature is 350 degrees fahrenheit/176 degrees celsius.</item>
        <item>now squeeze the bottle and make concentric rings with the batter.</item>
        <item>either start from the center and move outside or vice versa. be careful while making the jalebis as the oil is hot.</item>
        <item>you won\'t get perfect shapes as the jalebis keep on moving while you make the circles. this does require practice and it also depends on what equipment you are using to make the jalebis.</item>
        <item>when one side is partly cooked, turn over and fry the other side.</item>
        <item>some jalebis will be cooked faster than others.</item>
        <item>fry till the oil stops sizzling and the jalebis are a light golden. remove with a tongs or a bamboo skewer. while removing shake to drain the extra oil.</item>
        <item>then immediately put the fried jalebis in the sugar syrup. the sugar syrup should be slightly hot or warm when you add the jalebis in it.</item>
        <item>turn over after after a minute so that both sides are coated with the syrup.</item>
        <item>keep them in the syrup for about 2 to 3 minutes. if you keep for two minutes, they will be lightly colored and if you keep for 3 minutes, they will have a deep color.</item>
        <item>remove with a wooden skewer or tongs. shake lightly so that the excess sugar syrup falls back in the pan. place them in a plate or tray lined with a foil or butter paper.</item>
        <item>prepare all jalebis this way. its better to have a help while doing so. otherwise its kind of multi tasking.</item>
        <item>serve jalebis hot, warm or at room temperature. the leftovers can be kept in an airtight container and refrigerated.</item>

    <array name="DIRECTIONS_SW_ITC106">
        <item>In a bowl, take 250 grams of khoya or mawa. the khoya used for gulab jamuns is the soft khoya also known as daap ka khoya or chikna khoya. this is a soft khoya, so it mashes and kneads very well.</item>
        <item>mash the khoya very well with your hands. keep aside. there should be no lumps or small bits or pieces in the khoya. you can also grate and then mash the khoya. the mashed khoya should not feel granular.</item>
        <item>grate 100 grams paneer and keep aside. 100 grams paneer yields about ½ cup grated paneer. use a fine grater to grate the paneer.</item>
        <item>now add the grated paneer and 3 tbsp all purpose flour (maida) to the mashed khoya.</item>
        <item>add 1 tbsp milk.</item>
        <item>gently mix everything very well.</item>
        <item>bring together this mixture and form into a dough. do not knead the dough. just mix and gather to a dough. if the mixture looks dry and does not cling together to a dough, you can add 1 tbsp more of the milk</item>

        <item>roll all the jamuns this way and keep them covered with a cotton kitchen towel.</item>
        <item>making sugar syrup:</item>
        <item>take 2 cups sugar in a pan and add 1.5 cups water.</item>
        <item>keep this pan on stove top on a low to medium flame and stir so that the sugar begins to dissolve.</item>
        <item>when all the sugar is dissolved, add ¼ tsp lemon juice. the lemon juice does not allow the sugar syrup to crystallize.</item>
        <item>cook the sugar syrup on a low to medium flame till you get ½ string consistency or the syrup becomes sticky.</item>
        <item>switch off the flame and add ½ tsp cardamom powder and 12 to 15 strands of saffron, crushed. also add 1 tbsp rose water.</item>
        <item>frying and soaking jamuns:</item>
        <item>when the sugar syrup is cooking, you can begin frying the jamuns. as when you add the fried jamuns, the sugar syrup needs to be hot. heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep pan on a low to medium flame.</item>
        <item>for testing, slid a tiny dough ball in the hot oil. the ball should come up slowly and not quickly. this is the temperature at which we will fry the jamuns.</item>
        <item>keep the flame to a low and fry this tiny jamun ball.</item>
        <item>fry this small jamun till it becomes golden. if this jamun ball breaks, then add a few tsp of flour to the dough and mix well again. before you begin shaping the jamuns, you can do this test.</item>
        <item>now gently slid the jamuns. the flame should be low. do not crowd and add the jamuns as per the size of the pan.</item>
        <item>when you see light golden spots, turn over the jamuns gently. the jamuns fry very quickly, so do be attentive.</item>
        <item>keep on turning them in the oil, like a gentle swirling with the slotted spoon, so that they brown evenly.</item>
        <item>when frying the jamuns have to feel light and not heavy.</item>
        <item>fry till they turn golden. remove with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</item>
        <item>whilst they are hot, quickly add them to the sugar syrup. fry all the jamuns in the same way and add them to the sugar syrup. note that the sugar syrup has to be hot. to maintain the hot temperature, you can keep the sugar syrup bowl or pan on a hot water bath. cover and allow the jamuns to soak in the sugar syrup for about 2 hours.</item>
        <item>after 2 hours, gently strain the jamuns from the sugar syrup. then take each jamun and roll it in a small plate consisting of 2 to 3 tbsp sugar or 2 to 3 tbsp desiccated coconut.</item>
        <item>roll them well, so that the sugar or desiccated coconut coats evenly. place them in a bowl or container. close with a lid and refrigerate.</item>

        <item>3. Heat the milk in a heavy bottomed pan and add the carrot to it. </item>
        <item>4. Cover and cook it on medium flame, stirring occassionally to avoid sticking to the bottom. </item>
        <item>5. After about 15-20 minutes, when all the milk is absorbed by the carrot, add sugar and stir continuously.</item>
        <item>6. After about 8 minutes the oil starts getting separated from the halwa. At this stage add cardomom powder, fried nuts and raisins and 1 tblsp of ghee.</item>
        <item>7. Mix for another minute and switch off.</item>

        <item>1.Take a mixing pan and add plain water to it. Add crushed jaggery to it and let it stand till it completely dissolves. (This step can be done overnight also to save time )</item>
        <item>2.Once the jaggery has completely dissolved in the water, add wheat flour to it and mix well , till no flour lumps are visible and the batter looks consistent.</item>
        <item>3.Let the batter rest for 2-3 minutes. Fennel seeds can be added to it here - sprinkle over and allow them to be drawn in the batter on their own.</item>
        <item>4.Spread oil on the griddle and heat it on the low-medium flame. Once the griddle is hot, turn the flame to low and carefully spread about 2-3 tbs of batter in the form of thin flat pancake.</item>
        <item>5.As the pancake cooks, its color changes to golden , carefully lift and poora / pancake with a flat ladle and flip the side and let other side also cook to golden brown. </item>
        <item>6.At this stage, the griddle can be covered with a lid, that will retain the heat and moisture inside and help in cooking the poora faster.</item>
        <item>7.Once the poora seems to be readily coming off the griddle, carefully transfer it to the serving dish. Repeat the steps for the rest of the batter and prepare other pooras. </item>
        <item>8.In a separate pan / pot, allow the milk to boil over medium - high flame. Once the milk comes to boil, add rice to it and keep stirring with the ladle at regular intervals to ensure rice does not stick to the pan surface / form lump in some corner. </item>
        <item>9. Once the milk reduces to almost half the volume, switch off the flame. Add sugar to the pan and mix well with rice and milk cooked together. Our Rice Kheer is ready. Let it cool.</item>
